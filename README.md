🌐💻 Web Wizard | Code Conqueror | Bookworm 📚 | Fitness Fanatic 🏋️⚡

From hacking forums with Kali Linux at 15 to mastering Java and web development at 16, my journey has led me to become a passionate web developer. Check out all my projects on GitHub! 🔗

While pursuing my university education, I also delved into Android app development and Bug Bounties. I even wrote articles and created a paper on Spectral Clustering, outperforming sklearn! 📱🐛

In addition to my coding adventures, I've dived into some enlightening reads like "The Effective Engineer" and "Atomic Habits." These books have shaped my approach to writing efficient code and building productive habits. 🚀

When I'm not crafting impeccable websites, I channel my energy into intense workouts six times a week. Balancing physical and mental well-being is key for my success in both work and personal life. 💪
