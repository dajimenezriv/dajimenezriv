I started my programming journey at 15, moving from Kali Linux to learning Java and web development at 16. I founded a startup, where I served as Chief Technology Officer (CTO), leading the development of a robust web application using React, Django and PostgreSQL. Explore my coding projects on GitHub.

During my college education, I diversified my skills into Android app development. My bachelor's degree in computer science specialized in artificial intelligence, where I wrote a paper on Spectral Clustering.

Beyond programming, I prioritize physical and mental well-being and do intense workouts five days a week. Guided by books such as "The Effective Engineer" and "Atomic Habits", I integrate efficient coding practices and productive habits in both work and life.
